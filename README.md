### Silent Lens 

A chill Astro website where I dump random photos. Just explored Astro and deployed it on Vercel for the first time, lol!

### Live Demo

### Built With  
- Astro (my first time!).  
- A sprinkle of HTML/CSS. 
- Vercel (also my first deploy!).  

---

### Why This Exists  
- Practice Astro.  
- Learn Vercel deployments.
- Showcase random photos I take.  
- Zero pressure, just vibes.

### What's Inside?  
- A scrollable feed of my random shots.
- Super simple layout (because I'm still learning) .
